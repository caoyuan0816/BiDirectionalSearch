# BiDirectionalSearch
A course project for ASU CSE571.
## Introduction
- BFS, DFS, A*, Bi-directional Search(MM and MM0) for pacman and Rubik's Cube.
- We reused pacman code from CSE571 course project1.
- Implemented 2-d Rubik's cube game interface.
## Prerequirement
- Python2 (Only python2)
## Important Locations
- Search algorithms for pacman located in `/pacman/search.py`.
- Problem class and heuristic function for pacman located in `/pacman/searchAgents.py`.
- Search algorithms and heuristic function for Rubik's cube located in `/cube/solver.py`.
- Layouts of pacman located in `\pacman\layouts`.
- Layouts of Rubik's cube located in `\cube\test`.
- Main entrances: `\pacman\pacman.py` and `\cube\rubikCube.py`.
- Auto tester for Rubik's cube, `\cube\test.py`(Python 3 required for running that tester).
## Run tests
### Pacman
We modified code from course project1, therefore, only one kind of problem (PositionSearchProblem) and one kind of heuristic function (foodHeuristic) can be supported. We only support 4 types of maze: tiny, small, medium and big.
Examples:
- To run `bfs` test with medium size maze: `python2 pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs,prob=PositionSearchProblem`.
- To run `dfs` test with tiny size maze: `python2 pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=dfs,prob=PositionSearchProblem`.
- To run `astar` test with medium size maze: `python2 pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,prob=PositionSearchProblem,heuristic=foodHeuristic`.
- To run `bi-directional MM0` test with medium size maze: `python2 pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bd0,prob=PositionSearchProblem`.
- To run `bi-directional MM` test with big size maze: `python2 pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bd,prob=PositionSearchProblem,heuristic=foodHeuristic`.
### Rubik's Cube
We have two modes for testing: `single` and `multi`. In `single` mode, script will load a single test data contained layout file from `/pacman/test`, then run the solver and show user game interface. In `multi` mode, script will load a multiple test data contained layout file from `/pacman/test`, then run the solver and will not show user the game interface. For each test, user can choose one algorithm from: `bfs`, `dfs`, `astar`, `bd` and `bd0`. Examples:
- To run single (with game interface) `bfs` test with layout file `single_rand_2_1`: `python2 rubikCube.py single single_rand_2_1 bfs`.
- To run multi `astar` test with layout file `multi_rand_4`: `python2 rubikCube.py multi multi_rand_4 astar`.
- To run multi `bi-directional MM0` test with layout file `multi_rand_8`: `python2 rubikCube.py multi multi_rand_8 bd0`.
## Test Data Generation (Simulate User Input)
We provide a script `/pacman/generateTestData.py` to generate test data for Rubik's cube problem. The script will based on input simulate user's random input to generate layout. All layout will be guaranteed valid. For `multi` test data, we will generate 100 time `single` test data and store it in to `multi` test data file. Examples:
- To generate a single test data simulating 1 random operation by user named `single_rand_1`: `python2 generateTestData.py single 1 single_rand_1`.
- To generate a multiple test data simulating 12 random operation by user named `multi_rand_10`: `python2 generateTestData.py multi 10 multi_rand_10`.
